Last Flight of the Laika
========================


Gameplay
========

Currently _Laika_ is a text based game, so gameplay is rather simple. Run 
laika\_core/runme.py to start the game. 


Code Structure
==============

Most code currently lives in laikia\_core. In it there are several files, one
file per class. character.py has the character class, event.py has the event 
class, item.py is in the item class. The game loop is held in runme.py.

The code is desinged to be mostly object oriented.


Design Revisions
================
Due to lazyness and procrastination, I have not yet implemented the UI, so
gameplay is all text based. The essence of the game is on the decisions, so 
I don't believe it is a major deviance.
